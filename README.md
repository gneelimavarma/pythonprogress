# Everyday progress on python
**Python installation**

 1. Download python for 64 bit machine and set path variable (right click on my computer-->go to properties, add 'C:/Python36' to PATH variable)
 2. Bring up cmd prompt , enter python -v to check python version
 3. To exit python interpreter , use ctrl Z or exit().
 4. Install geany (texteditor) to run python programs
 
**Python primer**
 - To run a python script 'python hello.py' , to run it in interactive mode 'python -i hello.py,
 - Python is a **dynamically typed language**, which means need not specify the type of identifier while declaring unlike other languages.
			 eg: temperature = 98.6
 Here temperature is an identifier pointing to mem address where object is stored. 'temperature' here is an object of float class.
-Interestingly int,float and string are classes in python unlike objective C,java where they are primitive data types

 - if we do temperature = room_temp then room temp has become '**alias**' of 'temperature', which means they point to the same object. However '*assigning*' a new value to any one will break the alias.eg: room_temp = room_temp+5 , here room_temp = 103.6 and temperature remains 98.6.
